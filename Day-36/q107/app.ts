// Question 107: Write a condition using logical operators that checks if a number
//  is divisible by both 2 and 3.

// Explain & TIP: Checking for divisibility involves using the modulo operator (%)
//  to see if there's any remainder. A number divisible by both 2 and 3 without a 
//  remainder is also divisible by 6.

function divisibility(num:number):boolean{
      return (num % 2 === 0 && num % 3 === 0)
}

console.log(divisibility(6));
console.log(divisibility(24));
console.log(divisibility(22));
